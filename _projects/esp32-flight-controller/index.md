# Aerospace Data Analysis

Advanced aerodynamic and flight data analysis project focused on optimizing aeronautical performance through data science and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the systematic analysis of large datasets from wind tunnel tests, numerical simulations, and real flight data to identify patterns and optimize aerodynamic performance.

## Analysis Methodologies

### Advanced Statistical Analysis
- **Multivariate regression** for aerodynamic parameter correlation
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** for critical factor identification
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction
- **Machine learning** for operational performance prediction

### Processing and Data Handling
- **Digital filtering** and preprocessing of high-frequency telemetry signals
- **Spatial interpolation** of 3D velocity and pressure fields
- **Environmental corrections** for flight data standardization
- **Advanced visualization** of complex multidimensional datasets

## Technology Stack

- **Matlab**: Primary environment for numerical and statistical analysis
- **Python**: Machine learning, automation and visualization with matplotlib/seaborn
- **Julia**: Intensive numerical calculations and algorithmic optimization
- **Excel**: Reporting and dashboards for non-technical stakeholders

## Achieved Results

The analysis enabled significant improvements:

### Aerodynamic Performance
- **15% improvement** in aerodynamic efficiency (L/D ratio)
- **Identification** of optimal configurations for different operational conditions
- **8% reduction** in parasitic drag through shape optimization

### Predictive Models
- **ML models** with >95% accuracy for performance prediction
- **Multi-objective optimization** algorithms for design trade-offs
- **Normalized database** for cross-platform correlations between different aircraft

## Practical Applications

- **Design optimization** of airfoils for UAVs and commercial aircraft
- **Validation** of CFD models through comparison with experimental data
- **Development** of empirical correlations for quick aerodynamic assessment
- **Decision support** for configuration choices in preliminary design phase
