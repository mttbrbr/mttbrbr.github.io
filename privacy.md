## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how this website ("the Site") collects, uses, and protects information when you visit and interact with it.

This is a personal blog with minimal data collection. I respect your privacy and am committed to transparency about what limited data is processed.

## Data Controller

The data controller for this website is:

**Matteo Barbieri**  
Email: matteo.barbieri@example.com

## Hosting and Technical Data

This website is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. When you visit the Site, GitHub may automatically collect certain technical information to provide the hosting service, including:

- IP address
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Date and time of access
- Pages visited

This data is collected and processed by GitHub according to their Privacy Policy. For more information, please refer to:

I do not have direct access to this server log data.

## Data We Collect Directly

### Local Storage

The Site uses browser **localStorage** to remember your theme preference (light or dark mode). This data:
- Is stored only on your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser data
- Does not identify you personally

### External Resources

The Site loads the following external resource:
- **Anime.js** library from Cloudflare CDN (cdnjs.cloudflare.com) for animations

When you visit the Site, your browser may send requests to this CDN, which may collect technical information according to their privacy policy.

## Cookies

This website **does not use cookies** for tracking or analytics purposes.

The only data stored locally is the theme preference mentioned above, which uses localStorage (not cookies).

## Third-Party Services

This website does **not** use:
- Google Analytics or similar analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media tracking pixels
- Comment systems (like Disqus)
- Newsletter services

The Site includes links to external social media profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Mastodon) and your email client. When you click these links, you will leave the Site and be subject to the privacy policies of those platforms.

## RSS Feed

The Site provides an RSS feed that allows you to subscribe to new content. Subscribing to the RSS feed does not require providing any personal information to the Site itself, though your RSS reader may collect data according to its own privacy policy.

## Your Rights (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

- **Right to erasure**: You can request deletion of your data
- **Right to restrict processing**: You can request limitation of data processing
- **Right to data portability**: You can request transfer of your data

Given the minimal nature of data collection on this Site, most of these rights are already satisfied (as we don't store personal data about you). If you have concerns, please contact me at the email address above.
